# Introduction
st.subheader("Introduction")
st.write("""
Mushrooms are an essential part of the ecosystem, but identifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous can be tricky. 
This project aims to classify mushrooms based on their features using machine learning. A Random Forest Classifier has been trained on the dataset to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

# Dataset Description
st.subheader("Dataset Details")
st.write("""
The dataset contains information on various physical features of mushrooms, including:
- Cap Shape
- Cap Surface
- Cap Color
- Odor
- Gill Color
- Habitat, and more.

The target variable is `class`, which categorizes mushrooms into:
- **Edible (e)**
- **Poisonous (p)**.

# Data Statistics
st.subheader("Dataset at a Glance")
st.write("""
The dataset consists of **8124 rows** and **23 features**. All features are categorical, making it ideal for label encoding.
Below is a brief description of the dataset:

- Number of Samples: 8124
- Features: 22 (e.g., cap shape, odor, habitat)
- Target Variable: class (edible/poisonous)
- Data Type: Categorical

# Process Description
st.subheader("Process Overview")
st.write("""
The process for mushroom classification involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical features using LabelEncoder.
2. **Splitting the Dataset**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest Classifier on the training data.
4. **Prediction**: Predicting whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on user inputs.
5. **Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve for performance assessment.
